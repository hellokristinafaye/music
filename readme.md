Overview:

- Basic web page with pretty design and a music player.

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
  - float
- JavaScript
  - variables
  - .onclick
  - if else statement that toggles play/pause

Features:

Challenges:

- Some of the tutorial's code seemed a little deprecated, so we improved and updated it to work.
  - audio syntax
  - .play() kept trying to become .onplay(), not sure the difference

Future Development:

- I probably won't develop this page any further, but may reference it in case future project require similar features.
